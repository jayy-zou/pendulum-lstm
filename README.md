## Predicting Chaotic Double Pendulum with LSTMs
In this project, I aim to predict the trajectory of a chaotic double pendulum with machine learning techniques, in particular the LSTM (longshort-term memeory).
## Physics
The double pendulum is a simple dynamical system with one pendulum attached to the end of the other pendulum, as shown in Figure 1.
